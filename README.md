# AAROC Posters
A repo for all of our wonderful posters !

# What can I put in here ? 
  
  1. This repo is for dissemination. You can put anything that fits the bill, but mostly posters and flyers. 
  1. Presentations are also ok, but ***Please use vector formats*** such as SVG, or HTML (ie, stuff git can deal with).

# Sharing and re-use 

We encourage using these posters at events, in departments, etc. Feel free to add your own, but note that the repo is under an Mozilla Public License. That means that you need to be careful about metadata when adding things. 

Re-use is permitted, as long as the original source is cited.
